# newton-s-cradle-in-python
This project is a visualization of pendulum swings using the Turtle library in the Python programming language. Pendulums of various lengths and masses create animations, and kinetic and potential energy is displayed with the ability to enter parameters such as angle of deflection, mass and height of the ball.

# installing libraries and starting the project
Step 1: Make sure you have Python installed. If not, download and install the latest version;
Step 2: Create a virtual environment (recommended, but optional): python -m venv myenv;
Step 3: Activate the virtual environment: For Windows: myenv\Scripts\activate;
Step 4: Install the Turtle library: pip install PythonTurtle;
Step 5: Save your code in a file with a .py extension, for example main.py;
Step 6: Run the file using Python: main.py

# instructions for use
After starting the program, a window with visualization of pendulums will appear.
Enter the deflection angle, ball mass, and ball height when prompted for input.
The animation of the pendulums will begin taking into account the entered parameters.
The window displays the kinetic and potential energy of the pendulum in real time.
To terminate the program, use the Ctrl + C key combination at the command line.
The project is ready to use and you can adjust the pendulum parameters, watch the animation and monitor the energy parameters.
